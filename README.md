# ai-fuelled-analytics
This repo is a demo of Microsoft's [LIDA](https://microsoft.github.io/lida/), which uses the power of LLMs to automate data analytics and visualization for large datasets. This project is open-source on GitHub.

In this demo we try the following functionality -
1. Generate Visualization Goals and Chart Them
2. Generate Visualizations based on User Queries
3. Retrieve Python Code and Explain Generated Charts
4. Refine Vizualization with Natural Language
5. Self-Evaluation and Repair Visualizations
